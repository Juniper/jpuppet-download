*Update March 2022* 

*EOL plan: Starting releases with FreeBSD12 and LTS19 support for Ruby is very patchy. Support for these modules is stopped by the Juniper engineering team on all Junos and EVO releases using these upgraded OS versions.*

*Marking the repo as 'read-only'*

This is repository of Puppet packages released by Juniper Networks for use on Juniper Networking devices.

Reference: [Puppet for Junos OS Documentation] (http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/release-independent/junos-puppet/information-products/pathway-pages/index.html)

Note: Puppet packages for older Junos releases (1.0 version of Puppet packages) are not available for download.
